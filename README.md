SIMPLE OPERATING SYSTEM

Goal:

The objective of this assignment is the simulation of major components in a simple operating system,
for example, scheduler, synchronization, related operations of physical memory, and virtual memory.

Content:

In detail, students will practice with three major modules: scheduler, synchronization, mechanism
of memory allocation from virtual-to-physical memory.

• scheduler

• synchronization

• the operations of mem-allocation from virtual-to-physical

Result:

After this assignment, you can understand partly the principle of a simple OS. You can draw
the role and meaning of key modules in the OS as well as how it works.
